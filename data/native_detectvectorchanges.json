{"Title": "Detect dataset changes", "Abstract": "Calculates features which are unchanged, added or deleted between two dataset versions.\n\nThis algorithm compares two vector layers, and determines which features are unchanged, added or deleted between the two. It is designed for comparing two different versions of the same dataset.\n\nWhen comparing features, the original and revised feature geometries will be compared against each other. Depending on the Geometry Comparison Behavior setting, the comparison will either be made using an exact comparison (where geometries must be an exact match for each other, including the order and count of vertices) or a topological comparison only (where geometries are considered equal if all of their component edges overlap. E.g. lines with the same vertex locations but opposite direction will be considered equal by this method). If the topological comparison is selected then any z or m values present in the geometries will not be compared.\n\nBy default, the algorithm compares all attributes from the original and revised features. If the Attributes to Consider for Match parameter is changed, then only the selected attributes will be compared (e.g. allowing users to ignore a timestamp or ID field which is expected to change between the revisions).\n\nIf any features in the original or revised layers do not have an associated geometry, then care must be taken to ensure that these features have a unique set of attributes selected for comparison. If this condition is not met, warnings will be raised and the resultant outputs may be misleading.\n\nThe algorithm outputs three layers, one containing all features which are considered to be unchanged between the revisions, one containing features deleted from the original layer which are not present in the revised layer, and one containing features added to the revised layer which are not present in the original layer.", "Identifier": "native:detectvectorchanges", "Input": [[{"Title": "ORIGINAL"}, {"Abstract": "Original layer"}, {"Identifier": "ORIGINAL"}, {"Parameter type": "QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSource"}, {"Accepted data types": [{"str": "layer ID"}, {"str": "layer name"}, {"str": "layer source"}, "QgsProcessingFeatureSourceDefinition", "QgsProperty", "QgsVectorLayer"]}], [{"Title": "REVISED"}, {"Abstract": "Revised layer"}, {"Identifier": "REVISED"}, {"Parameter type": "QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSource"}, {"Accepted data types": [{"str": "layer ID"}, {"str": "layer name"}, {"str": "layer source"}, "QgsProcessingFeatureSourceDefinition", "QgsProperty", "QgsVectorLayer"]}], [{"Title": "COMPARE_ATTRIBUTES"}, {"Abstract": "Attributes to consider for match (or none to compare geometry only)"}, {"Identifier": "COMPARE_ATTRIBUTES"}, {"Parameter type": "QgsProcessingParameterField"}, {"Accepted data types": ["str", "QgsProperty"]}], [{"Title": "MATCH_TYPE"}, {"Abstract": "Geometry comparison behavior"}, {"Identifier": "MATCH_TYPE"}, {"Parameter type": "QgsProcessingParameterEnum"}, {"Available values": [{"0": "Exact Match"}, {"1": "Tolerant Match (Topological Equality)"}]}, {"Accepted data types": ["int", {"str": "as string representation of int, e.g. '1'"}, "QgsProperty"]}], [{"Title": "UNCHANGED"}, {"Abstract": "Unchanged features"}, {"Identifier": "UNCHANGED"}, {"Parameter type": "QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSink"}, {"Accepted data types": [{"str": "destination vector file, e.g. 'd:/test.shp'"}, {"str": "'memory:' to store result in temporary memory layer"}, {"str": "using vector provider ID prefix and destination URI, e.g. 'postgres:\u2026' to store result in PostGIS table"}, "QgsProcessingOutputLayerDefinition", "QgsProperty"]}], [{"Title": "ADDED"}, {"Abstract": "Added features"}, {"Identifier": "ADDED"}, {"Parameter type": "QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSink"}, {"Accepted data types": [{"str": "destination vector file, e.g. 'd:/test.shp'"}, {"str": "'memory:' to store result in temporary memory layer"}, {"str": "using vector provider ID prefix and destination URI, e.g. 'postgres:\u2026' to store result in PostGIS table"}, "QgsProcessingOutputLayerDefinition", "QgsProperty"]}], [{"Title": "DELETED"}, {"Abstract": "Deleted features"}, {"Identifier": "DELETED"}, {"Parameter type": "QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSink"}, {"Accepted data types": [{"str": "destination vector file, e.g. 'd:/test.shp'"}, {"str": "'memory:' to store result in temporary memory layer"}, {"str": "using vector provider ID prefix and destination URI, e.g. 'postgres:\u2026' to store result in PostGIS table"}, "QgsProcessingOutputLayerDefinition", "QgsProperty"]}]], "Outputs": [[{"Title": "UNCHANGED"}, {"Abstract": "Unchanged features"}, {"Parameter type": "QgsProcessingOutputVectorLayer"}], [{"Title": "ADDED"}, {"Abstract": "Added features"}, {"Parameter type": "QgsProcessingOutputVectorLayer"}], [{"Title": "DELETED"}, {"Abstract": "Deleted features"}, {"Parameter type": "QgsProcessingOutputVectorLayer"}], [{"Title": "UNCHANGED_COUNT"}, {"Abstract": "Count of unchanged features"}, {"Parameter type": "QgsProcessingOutputNumber"}], [{"Title": "ADDED_COUNT"}, {"Abstract": "Count of features added in revised layer"}, {"Parameter type": "QgsProcessingOutputNumber"}], [{"Title": "DELETED_COUNT"}, {"Abstract": "Count of features deleted from original layer"}, {"Parameter type": "QgsProcessingOutputNumber"}]]}
